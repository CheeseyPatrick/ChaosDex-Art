# ChaosDex
## Inspired by Ballsdex

### ChaosDex isn't just a Ballsdex spinoff - it is built from the ground up
Currently in testing phase. ChaosDex features a state-of-the-art battling system, among the rest of the features of the familiar Balldex bot.
This GitHub repo does not contain the source code of ChaosDex, it is a place for anyone to suggest their own Chadoxes.

## Contributing
Want to create a Chadox? You can use the generator [here](https://chaosdex.vercel.app/) and then post that file AND the card preview to [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/eW37wnap9e) in [#chadox-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/1330303355444138065/1330621352998207649). We will decide if your Chadox is a good addition and if it is then we will add it for all to have!
